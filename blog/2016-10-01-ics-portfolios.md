The TechFolio team is happy to announce the initial release of [ICS Portfolios](https://ics-portfolios.github.io), a site providing a portal to dozens of TechFolios created by students and faculty in the [Department of Information and Computer Science](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu) at the [University of Hawaii](http://www.hawaii.edu).

ICS Portfolios leverages the use of JSON Resume format to build a directory of the ICS community with a summary of each member along with a link to their professional portfolios for details. 

If you are a member of the ICS community (student, faculty, or alumni) and would like to be included, please let us know.
