The TechFolios team is pleased to announce a new major release of TechFolios.  Since its initial release almost 7 years ago, TechFolios has been used by almost 2,000 software developers to create their professional portfolio. We've taken our experience over the years into account when designing this release which we believe provides a significantly improved experience for users.  

A summary of the improvements in TechFolios 2 include:

  1. Update from Jekyll 3 to [Jekyll 4](https://jekyllrb.com/).
  2. Update of CSS framework from Semantic UI 2.4 to [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/).
  3. Use of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to:
     * Indicate when the build fails (and whether it's due to a syntax error in bio.json)
     * Indicate when the portfolio has been deployed and is ready for viewing
  4. A refreshed, modernized [default layout](https://techfolios.github.io/template/) incorporating a single page design.
  5. Refreshed and improved documentation using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
  6. [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) meta-data to improve URL display.
  7. Simplified theming using [Bootstrap CSS variables](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/css-variables/).

We believe this creates a firm foundation for the next 7 years and two thousand developers!
