## Philip Johnson

This portfolio customizes the default template in the following way:

* The headshot is smaller, and the Interests and Network icons are full-width and below the picture and summary.
* There are more than 4 projects and 6 essays, illustrating the (built-in) "See all" feature for projects and essays.
* The site provides a curriculum vitae rather than a resume. This is implemented by:
  * Extensions to bio.json to include publications.
  * A new cv.html page to replace resume.html.
  * Modifications to header.html to provide "CV" as the label which links to the cv.html page.
* The projecturl and essayurl features are used to link to external sites in some cases. 
* The site is available at a custom domain (philipmjohnson.org).

This portfolio customizes the default template in the following ways:

* About section is modified to put the summary paragraph below the headshot and network icons.
* A new section called "Papers" provides access to publications.
* A new "About" page provides a brief biographical sketch.
* The navbar has a "CV" link that goes directly to a PDF version of the CV. There is no HTML page.
* The site is available at a custom domain (kambergjohnson.com).

Yes, in case you were wondering at the resemblence, Katie agreed to allow her headshot to be used for the Molly Maluhia template!
