## Philip Johnson

This portfolio provides examples of several customizations to the default template:

* The headshot is smaller, and the Interests and Network icons are full-width and below the picture and summary.
* There are more than 4 projects and 6 essays, illustrating the (built-in) "See all" feature for projects and essays.
* The site provides a curriculum vitae rather than a resume. This is implemented by modifications to the header.html to provide "CV" as the label and link to a custom cv.html page.
* The projecturl and essayurl features are used to link to external sites in some cases. 
* The site is available at a custom domain (philipmjohnson.org).
