Don't hesitate to request help if you run into difficulties creating or maintaining your professional portfolio.

In general, the best way to request help is to [create a new issue in the techfolios/template repository](https://github.com/techfolios/template/issues).  Please describe your problem and provide the URL to your repository. 


If that doesn't seem like the best approach, then feel free to send an email to the TechFolios project team leader:
