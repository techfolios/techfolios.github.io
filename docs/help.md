Don't hesitate to request help if you run into difficulties creating or maintaining your professional portfolio, or if you have come up with a cool custom portfolio that you'd like to show us.

In general, the best way to request help for problems is to [create a new issue in the techfolios/template repository](https://github.com/techfolios/template/issues).  Please describe your problem and provide the URL to your repository. 

If that doesn't seem like the best approach, or if you want to show us your customized portfolio, then please feel free to send an email to the TechFolios project team leader:
