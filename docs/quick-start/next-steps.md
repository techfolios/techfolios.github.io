title: Next steps

Finishing this Quick Start is a significant step forward in the development of your professional portfolio, but there is more you might want to do, including:

* This Quick Start only results in one project and one essay. You probably have more than one project or essay to include.
* Your project and essays were rather minimal. To best present yourself, you'll want to use more sophisticated formatting, including lists, links, subsections, images, GitHub gists, and so forth.
* You might want to personalize your portfolio with different colors and/or fonts.
* You might want to make more extensive changes to the layout, such as changing "Resume" to "CV", or adding new pages to the menubar, or other modifications.

Learning to make all of these changes is the subject of the next Chapter, the User Guide.
