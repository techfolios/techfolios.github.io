title: Missing pages
hide_table_of_contents: true

The template techfolio comes with default handling when users request an URL not associated with the site (i.e. 404 errors). The default response is to indicate that the URL was not found and provide a list of links to all projects and essays. For example:

![](/img/user-guide/missing-page.png)

This is helpful if you are transitioning to TechFolio from another professional portfolio site and worry that others might have bookmarked URLs that will no longer point correctly to your updated essay and project pages.

If you prefer to handle 404 errors in a different way, the best way is to create a copy of the missingpage.html layout file (such as my-missingpage.html) and then edit the 404.html to point to your new my-missingpage layout.
